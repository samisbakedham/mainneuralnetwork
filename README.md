# mainneuralnetwork


- Creating a simple neural network in Python with one input layer (3 inputs) and one output neuron. A neural network with no hidden layers is called a perceptron.

- The neural net tries to predict the output given 3 binary inputs. If the first input is 1, the output should be one. Otherwise the output should be 0.
